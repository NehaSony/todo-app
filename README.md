[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This react application consumes APIs from a basic todo application. Code at https://github.com/NehaSony/todo-app

- The application displays all the todo's added from the backend.
- The application helps change the status of todo items


## Features

• A user can view her/his task list 
• User can update task status
• All changes be persisted within an application run 
• All changes can be persistent to allow view them with page refresh 

## Tech

- [react] - npm - 7.21.1


And of course sourced as an open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Requires [npm 7] to run.


```
npm install
npm run
```


Application starts as port 3080


## Approach

The Todo APIs provide basic functionality of an application that can be used to view task list and update their status.

## Future Inhacements

User provided input should be used to add tasks.
Option to modify task description.
Remove task from the list

Login module is very much need if we want to be storing personal task list.
This application could be extended to be used by multiple users.
